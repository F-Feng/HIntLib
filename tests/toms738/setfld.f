      SUBROUTINE SETFLD (QIN)
      INTEGER QIN
C
C   This version : 12 December 1991
C
C   This subroutine sets up addition, multiplication, and
C   subtraction tables for the finite field of order QIN.
C   If necessary, it reads precalculated tables from the file
C   'gftabs.dat' using unit 1.  These precalculated tables
C   are supposed to have been put there by GFARIT.
C
C      *****  For the base-2 programs, these precalculated
C      *****  tables are not needed and, therefore, neither
C      *****  is GFARIT.
C
C
C   Unit 1 is closed both before and after the call of SETFLD.

C USES
C   Integer function CHARAC gets the characteristic of a field.

C
C   The following COMMON block, used by many subroutines,
C   gives the order Q of a field, its characteristic P, and its
C   addition, multiplication and subtraction tables.
C   The parameter MAXQ gives the order of the largest field to
C   be handled.
C
      INTEGER MAXQ
      PARAMETER (MAXQ=50)
 
      INTEGER P, Q, ADD(0:MAXQ-1,0:MAXQ-1)
      INTEGER MUL(0:MAXQ-1, 0:MAXQ-1), SUB(0:MAXQ-1, 0:MAXQ-1)
      COMMON /FIELD/ P, Q, ADD, MUL, SUB
      SAVE /FIELD/
C
C   The following definitions concern the representation of
C   polynomials.
C
      INTEGER MAXDEG, DEG
      PARAMETER (MAXDEG=50, DEG=-1)
C
C   The parameter MAXDEG gives the highest degree of polynomial
C   to be handled.  Polynomials stored as arrays have the
C   coefficient of degree n in POLY(N), and the degree of the
C   polynomial in POLY(-1).  The parameter DEG is just to remind
C   us of this last fact.  A polynomial which is identically 0
C   is given degree -1.
C
C   A polynomial can also be stored in an integer I, with
C        I = AN*Q**N + ... + A0.
C   Routines ITOP and PTOI convert between these two formats.
