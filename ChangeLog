     31213  105251  776193 total

+ Upgrade to GNU autoconf 1.57, GNU automake 1.7.8 and GNU LibTool 1.5
+ LibTool patches to work with ABI 64 an IRIX and Solaris
+ --with-index=X allows to set the data type of Index. The default uses the
  size of unsigned long int.
+ --with-real=X allows to chose between float, double, and long double for real
- HIntLib compiles and links on platforms without optimization and inlining
- Fixed some minor problems with the Intel C++ compiler "icpc"

+ New test-suite programs: test_abs, test_partition, test_prng
+ -t switch and clean-up in test_tparameter
+ Many new tests in test_genmatrix
+ Heuristic replaced by proper error analysis in test_rule

/ Name change: Function -> Integrand

+ Complete rewrite and extension of tparamter.cpp/tparameter.h
/ generatormatrix.h split up in ...matrix.h, ...matrix2.h, ...matrixgen.h
/ GeneratorMatrixGenX -> GeneratorMatrixVecX.
  GeneratorMatrixGen has a fixed vectorization of 1
+ Many clean-ups and some new functions in GeneratorMatrix*
+ Faure::init() optimized

+ Integrator::derivative() gives derivatives
+ Rule2Ionescu

- RefCountingAlgebra: setPointers() was not called in write()
- RefCountingAlgebra: Allocated memory was not aligned properly
+ Precalculated LookupField (calculated at compile time)
+ characteristic is part of shared data in LookupField

Algebraic structures:

+ algebra.h defines algebra_ and polynomial_tag's, TrivialFieldMembers and
  BitOpBasedAddition
+ algebra_tag and polynomial_tag used in all algebraic structures
+ test_arithmetic completely rewritten. Examines all features of all algebraic
  structures based on their algebra_category.
+ Many missing members included in various algebraic structures
+ print(), printShort() and printSuffix() for algebraic structures
+ PolynomialRing<A> can determine its algebra_category based on A
+ New algorithm for printing polynomials
+ PolynomialRing::quot() and ::rem() do not use ::div()
+ evaluate() for polynomial rings
/ Name change: ModularArithmetic* -> ModularArith*
/ ModularInteger* replaced by a specialization of ModularArith*
+ ModularArith detects polynomials and avoids unnecessary reductions
+ Additional eratosthenes() for arbitrary Euclidean rings
+ OneDimVectorSpace, GF2, GF2VectorSpace
/ Name change: PrecalculatedField* -> LookupField*
+ LookupField uses RefCountingAlgebra
+ LookupFieldPow2 and LookupFieldPrime (based on LookupFieldMulOnly)
+ LookupVectorSpace, LookupVectorSpacePow2, VectorSpacePow2

GeneratorMatrix:

- Output of GeneratorMatrix::dump() was transposed
+ Completely revised interface, allowing vectorization
  GeneratorMatrix2 becomes a special case of vectorization
+ New members: getVectorization(), getPrec(), getTotalPrec(), setVector(),
  getVector(), getDigit(), setDigit(), set(), setv()
/ Name change: dump* -> *Dump
+ operator== and operator= for arbitrary combinations of GeneratorMatrix'es
+ GMCopy object to specify copy operation

DigitalNetGen:

+ Vectorization
+ Accepts arbitrary GeneratorMatrix'es


DigitalNet2:

+ Adding -1.0 for IEEE-Magic is done as part of the ShiftScale
+ GF2VectorSpace and GF2 is used internally
+ Accepts arbitrary GeneratorMatrix'es with base=2
/ DigitalNet2Naive removed

Other changes:

+ t_parameter2 calculates a "restricted" t-parameter
+ operator<<(ostream&, X) treats falgs, precision and locale correctly
+ Prime::isPrimePower()
- tests/qrnsequence: exit1 instead of exit 1
+ tests/tparameter:  Checks t_parameter() and t_parameter2()

+ Vegas and Miser use arbitrary PointSets (as presented at MCQMC 2002).
  Some of the default parameters may not be optimal, so use at your own risk!
+ randomize() for PointSet and Integrator.
  Performs digital shift for DigitalNet.
- Code that is likely to produce infinity uses
  numeric_limits<real>::has_infinity to determine if it is save to do so.
- MIPSPro C++ 7.4 on SGI warns because of a missing copy assignment for
  Polynomial2<T>. Added it.
/ Make::generatorMatrix*() returns Mutable... instead of HeapAllocated...
/ All macro names (including #include-guards and macros defined in config.h)
  are prefixed with 'HINTLIB_'
- Use libtool convenience libraries to fix some dependency-tracking problems.
  Nothing is (superfluously) recompiled during a seconde make.
- @EXEEXT@ was missing in some dependencies in Makefile.am
+ Complicated m4 macro definitions moved from configure.ac to acinclude.m4
+ Upgrade to recent version of config.sub and config.guess (2003-02-22)
- test_qrnsequence: Wrong offsets for argv-array when in `net` mode


0.0.2    Mar 16, 2003

   wc src/*.cpp src/HIntLib/*.h | tail -1
     26343   90283  650607 total

+ Precalculated Niederreiter/Xing matrices are included.
  They are installed in $(prefix)/shared in a binary format
  Thanks to Gottlieb Pirsic for providing the data files!
- Some test scripts assumed '.' in $PATH  (Reinhold Kainhofer)
- Many improvements for systems with sizeof int, long, and long long not equal
  to 4/4/8. HIntLib compiles and links successfully on 64 bit platforms.
- HIntLib can be built outside the source directory
/ Name GenPolynomial2 changed to Polynomial2


0.0.1    Mar 8, 2003    First public beta release
