+ Vegas and Miser use arbitrary PointSets (as presented at MCQMC 2002).
  Some of the default parameters may not be optimal, so use at your own risk!
+ randomize() for PointSet and Integrator.
  Performs digital shift for DigitalNet.
- Code that is likely to produce infinity uses
  numeric_limits<real>::has_infinity to determine if it is save to do so.
- MIPSPro C++ 7.4 on SGI warns because of a missing copy assignment for
  Polynomial2<T>. Added it.
/ Make::generatorMatrix*() returns Mutable... instead of HeapAllocated...
/ All macro names (including #include-guards and macros defined in config.h)
  are prefixed with 'HINTLIB_'
- Use libtool convenience libraries to fix some dependency-tracking problems.
  Nothing is (superfluously) recompiled during a seconde make.
- @EXEEXT@ was missing in some dependencies in Makefile.am
+ Complicated m4 macro definitions moved from configure.ac to acinclude.m4
+ Upgrade to recent version of config.sub and config.guess (2003-02-22)
- test_qrnsequence: Wrong offsets for argv-array when in `net` mode

  Thanks to Gottlieb Pirsic for providing the data files!
